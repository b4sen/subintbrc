# 1brc

This is based on these two repos (shamelessly copied):
- https://github.com/tonybaloney/subinterpreter-web/
- https://github.com/dougmercer-yt/1brc/blob/main/src/doug_booty4.py

An experiment to test out the 1brc with the newly introduced subinterpreters. Can use optimizations as I just wanted to parallelize stuff. You'll need python 3.12, no extra dependencies.

```python
time python -m subintbrc ~/subintbrc/data/weather_stations.csv
```
